# Battleship

Battleship is a classic game of strategy and precision. The objective is to strategically place your fleet of ships on a grid and take turns with an opponent to target and destroy each other's vessels.

This project served as a platform for refining my object-oriented programming skills while implementing a seamless drag & drop functionality using vanilla JavaScript. Additionally, I applied a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to ensure robustness and reliability.
